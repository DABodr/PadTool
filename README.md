PadTool
=======

PadTool is a MOT SLS and DLS generator for PAD encoders such as ODR-PadEnc.

PadTool is able to read json, xml, txt or html files and outputs DLS+ text
from these informations and generates nice SLS with personnalized templates

PadTool is better to use with the ODR-mmbTools tool set, especially with ODR-PadEnc. 
More information about the ODR-mmbTools can be found in the *guide*, available on the
[Opendigitalradio mmbTools page](http://www.opendigitalradio.org/mmbtools).

Features of PadTool:

- Reads json, xml or txt files containing live informations
- Outputs DLS+ txt file compatible with ODR-PadEnc
- Outputs DAB compliant slides, JPG format with 320px x 240px resolution, and no more than 16kB sized files
- Windows and latest Linux versions fully compatible (tested with Ubuntu 18.04 and Windows 10)
- Easy personnalized DLS text with predefined tags
- Possible generation of a logo station slide
- Possible generation of ATC slide (Artist, Title & Cover)
