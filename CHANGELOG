	(v0.9.1):
		- Json Parser stills in beta, but seems to work pretty well, as i've got many
		positive feedbacks :-)
		- Rework on ChromeDriver usage : some issues were produced by the driver and slides
		weren't correctly generated after a couple of hours. 
		Bugs were amplified with supervisor (many ChromeDriver processes were thrown and 
		caused instabilities).
