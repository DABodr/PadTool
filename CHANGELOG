	(v0.9.4):
		- Automatic research for a cover, if not defined, can be enabled via the 
		[source]->researchCover parameter (0=disabled, 1=enabled) thanks to the CoverPy lib.
		Please see INSTALL in order to complete your installation.
		- Improved JSON parsing algorithm
		- DLS+ bugfix, not always generated when artistForm or titleForm parameters were used
		- Network fix: when a file (specified in [source]-> url) is not available due to
		network issues, or not found, PadTool tries to gather data from this file 5 times
		before being crashed. It avoids unexpected crashes.
		- Rework on plugins integration (calls each 5-10-15-30-60min)
		- First release with Unit Tests and Continuous Integration tests thanks to 
		PyTest and Travis CI included from this release (first batch of tests)

	(v0.9.3):
		- Json parser modification: several trials didn't work as expected, especially if
		the information about artist and title were in the first json item.
		- New feature: artist and title strings can be formated independently, with the 
		artistForm and titleForm parameters in the [general] section by using the following
		arguments:
			* 0 (by default): The string is as provided by the source file
			* 1: The string is entirely lowercase
			* 2: The string is entirely UPPERCASE
			* 3: The First Character Of Each Word Are Uppercase, While The Others Are Lowercase
		- DLS(+) generation code reworked and optimized
		- DLS(+): default DLS can be personnalized instead of "$radioName, $slogan" by using
		the [dls]->defaultDls parameter in the config file. When this option is not mentioned in 
		the config file, the defaultDls is "$radioName, $slogan"
		- Better integration for future plugins
		- Minor bugfix: DLS are generated with the default DLS (by default "$radioName, $slogan")
		when the artist and title tags are found in the template but not in the source file.

2020-02-11: Fabien Cuny
	(v0.9.2):
		Bugfixes :
		- Changed the way of logo slide generation (which could cause crashes with absolute paths)
		- Changed options in ChromeDriver usage to prevent Chrome failures in certain cases
		- In standalone mode, DLS and Slides were regenerated if artist and title were the same
		(reduces files generations and ChromeDriver calls). This part has to be optimized 
		in the future

2020-02-10: Fabien Cuny
	(v0.9.1):
		- Json Parser stills in beta, but seems to work pretty well, as i've got many
		positive feedbacks :-)
		- Rework on ChromeDriver usage : some issues were produced by the driver and slides
		weren't correctly generated after a couple of hours. 
		Bugs were amplified with supervisor (many ChromeDriver processes were thrown and 
		caused instabilities).

2020-01-27: Fabien Cuny
	(v0.9.0):
		- Huge rework on Json parsing files : Able now to parse variable json sized files.
		Actually in testing phase, because there is a lot of cases to think about.
		Please post an issue if you encounter problems.
		- Usage of ChromeDriver instead of PhantomJS which is deprecated. Please see INSTALL
		in order to complete your installation.
		- Modified slide generation processing in order to be fully compatible with ChromeDriver
		- Added date/time in the output.
		- Deletion of the residual ATC slide when none of the tags are found or filtered
		- Nice-to-have : Creation of the "out" directory when cloning this repository in order to
		launch examples without errors

2020-01-15: Fabien Cuny
	(v0.8.0):
		- Happy new year 2020, full of digital radio ! :-)
		- Added DAB-CTL mode in order to be fully compatible with the "DAB Control Interface" 
		software from V. Demarque (BCE)
		- DLS car now be generated outside the SLS directory if specified
		- DLS can be generated with or without DLS+ (DLS by default)
		Bugfixes :
			- Music (or ATC) slide generation crashed randomly. Wait time added in order 
			to complete the generation process.
			- Code optimization regarding proxy support and slide generation (no more temporary 
			files used anymore)
			- Under Linux distributions, the default cover did not appear when a cover URL 
			is pointing to an unexisting path.
